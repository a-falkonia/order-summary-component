## My process

### Built with

- BEM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries for responsiveness
- Lots of belief in myself 

### What I learned

I've tried achieveing a pixel-perfect desktop layout.
I learned some small useful tricks (for example, the overflow: hidden property and using Figma eyedropper tool to copy text color) and worked with active states.


### Continued development

I'm planning on tweaking the mobile version just a bit more :)
